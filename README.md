# NeuralComputing

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for Computational Neuroscience. This focuses on modeling:

1. Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron with adaptation

2. Adaptive Exponential Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (AELIF) neuron

3. Hodgkin-Huxley model as an oscillator

The project involves coding simulations, plotting graphs, and analyzing neuronal behaviors in response to different stimulation currents.
